    "First, let's extract the date and time from the `released_at` column in `msft_news_df`. Notice that the date and time are encoded in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<date>May 29 2012</date> <time>09:40:58</time>\n",
    "<date>May 18 2011</date> <time>22:42:40</time>\n",

    "```\n",

    "There are several ways to convert this to a `Timestamp` object that we can use more easily. However, for this assignment, we are going to use string manipulation functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a regular expression that extracts the Month, Day, Year, Hour, Minute, and Second from the `msft_news_df[\"released_at\"]` column. You should create a new `DataFrame` called `dates` that contains:\n",
    "1. The same index as `msft_news_df` (`id`) and\n",
    "2. Column labels: `\"Month\"`, `\"Day\"`, `\"Year\"`, `\"Hour\"`, `\"Minute\"`, `\"Second\"`.\n",

    "Additionally, convert all numerical values (`\"Year\"`, `\"Day\"`, `\"Hour\"`, `\"Minute\"`, `\"Second\"`) to type `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1:** You should use the [`Series.str.extract`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.extract.html) function.\n",

DistilBERT is a neural network-based language model (a close relative to ChatGPT); we will use the model checkpoint specifically trained for sentiment analysis. These models are not in scope for Data 100, and we don't expect you to know how they work; take CS182: Neural Networks or Data 102: Data, Inference, and Decisions if you're interested in learning more. We are using them here to show how easy (and useful) these technologies have become.\n",

[Here](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) is the card of the model checkpoint we will use for this assignment: the model card contains general information about the model, including the base model used, training arguments, training data, etc. Again, you don't need to know this for the course but knowing about model cards is important when you start to use these techniques in your careers.\n",

You should assume all sentences end with `.`, `?`, or `!` and that these punctuation characters are not used for any other purpose.
